Did you Ever Got into the Trouble of Making a good Looking UI for ESP8266 without having the skills to Build Perfect Webpages?
EasyUI is an User Interface Library for ESP8266 to Solve this Problem. This Library Uses Light-weight Websockets Protocol for Communicating with Webpage to Control, Make and Update Elements.

EasyUI uses functions native to arduino for creating the perfect Good Looking User Interface without the Need of Knowing Complex Javascripts etc.

## How to Install
###### Directly Through Arduino IDE
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Library Manager > Search for "EasyUI" > Install

###### Mannual Install

## Documentation

EasyUI is Based on [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) and Jquery for Handling Click Events Etc. The Communication Between ESP8266 and Webpage is with Websockets.
EasyUI is not Internet Dependent and will Continue working without any Internet Connection, All Assets are Loaded form ESP8266 Program Memory.

#### Following Functions can be Used in Sketch:

**To Detect Internet and Switch to CDN** 
The most Heaviest Part of the code is Jquery so, to make Webpages Load faster , user can use this function to switch between jquery served from esp memory or through online CDN when Internet is Available. (This Function is to be used in Station Mode Only!)
```
EasyUI.detectCDN(true);
```
<br>

**To Set an Title for your Webpage:**
This Line of Code will Add your Custom Title to the Webpage Displayed by ESP8266. By Default is "EasyUI".
```
EasyUI.title("");
```
<br>

**To Make Label on Webpage:**
This will add an Label on your Web Interface.
```
EasyUI.label("Title", "Value");
```
<br>

**To Make Toggle Button on Webpage:**
This will add an toggle Button on your Webpage. For Extra Functionality* See Below
```
EasyUI.toggleButton(pin,"Title");
```
<br>

**Start the Library:**
Once you have Specified Any of the above Elements, Use this Below them to Start Inializing the Library. <br>
```
EasyUI.begin();
```
<br>

**Loop Function:**
Don't Forget to Add this in your void loop()
```
EasyUI.loop();
```
<br>

## Extra Functionality
There are Some Elements in Library which have Added extra Functionality for Ease of Use.

**For Toggle Buttons:**
For Toggle Buttons There are 2 Extra Functionalities which can be defined by user.

- First is **{Start State}** , This is for Selecting if you want that **GPIO** to Start in **LOW** or **HIGH**. **By Default it's LOW.** (Define LOW or HIGH instead of '{Start State}' )

- Second **{Swap State}**, is useful for Swapping the States at which UI Buttons will work. making **'{Swap State}'** replace with **true** will make GPIO **LOW when Clicked "Turn On"** and **HIGH when clicked "Turn Off"**. By Default this is **false**.
```
EasyUI.toggleButton(pin, "Title", {Start State}, {Swap State});
```
