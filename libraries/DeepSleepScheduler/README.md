# Arduino DeepSleepScheduler Library #
https://github.com/PRosenb/DeepSleepScheduler

DeepSleepScheduler is a lightweight, cooperative task scheduler library with configurable sleep and task supervision.  

## Features ##
- Easy to use
- Configurable sleep with `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN` or `SLEEP_MODE_IDLE` while no task is running
- Configurable task supervision using hardware watchdog
- Schedule in interrupt
- Small footprint

## Installation ##
- The library can be installed directly in the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) as follows:
  - Menu Sketch->Include Library->Manage Libraries...
  - On top right in "Filter your search..." type: DeepSleepScheduler
  - The DeepSleepScheduler library will show
  - Click on it and then click "Install"
  - For more details see manual [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc3)
- If you do not use the [Arduino Software (IDE)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software):
  - [Download the latest version](https://github.com/PRosenb/DeepSleepScheduler/releases/latest)
  - Uncompress the downloaded file
  - This will result in a folder containing all the files for the library. The folder name includes the version: **DeepSleepScheduler-x.y.z**
  - Rename the folder to **DeepSleepScheduler**
  - Copy the renamed folder to your **libraries** folder
  - From time to time, check on https://github.com/PRosenb/DeepSleepScheduler if updates become available

## Getting Started ##
Simple blink:
```c++
#include <DeepSleepScheduler.h>
#define LED_PIN 13

bool ledOn = true;

void toggleLed() {
  if (ledOn) {
    ledOn = false;
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    ledOn = true;
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }
  scheduler.scheduleDelayed(toggleLed, 1000);
}

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  scheduler.schedule(toggleLed);
}

void loop() {
  scheduler.execute();
}
```
Simple blink with Runnable:
```c++
#include <DeepSleepScheduler.h>
#define LED_PIN 13

class BlinkRunnable: public Runnable {
  private:
    bool ledOn = true;
    const byte ledPin;
    const int delay;
  public:
    BlinkRunnable(byte ledPin, int delay) : ledPin(ledPin), delay(delay) {
      pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
    }
    virtual void run() {
      if (ledOn) {
        ledOn = false;
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
      } else {
        ledOn = true;
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
      }
      scheduler.scheduleDelayed(this, delay);
    }
};

void setup() {
  BlinkRunnable *blinkRunnable = new BlinkRunnable(LED_PIN, 1000);
  scheduler.schedule(blinkRunnable);
}

void loop() {
  scheduler.execute();
}
```

### Enumerations ###
```c++
enum TaskTimeout {
  TIMEOUT_15Ms,
  TIMEOUT_30MS,
  TIMEOUT_60MS,
  TIMEOUT_120MS,
  TIMEOUT_250MS,
  TIMEOUT_500MS,
  TIMEOUT_1S,
  TIMEOUT_2S,
  TIMEOUT_4S,
  TIMEOUT_8S,
  NO_SUPERVISION
};
```

### Define Options ###
- `#define LIBCALL_DEEP_SLEEP_SCHEDULER`: The header file contains definition and implementation. For that reason, it can be included once only in a project. To use it in multiple files, define `LIBCALL_DEEP_SLEEP_SCHEDULER` before all include statements except one.

All following options are to be set before the include where **no** `LIBCALL_DEEP_SLEEP_SCHEDULER` is defined:
- `#define SLEEP_MODE`: Specifies the sleep mode entered when doing deep sleep. Default is `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN`.
- `#define DEEP_SLEEP_DELAY`: Prevent the CPU from entering SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN for the specified amount of milliseconds after finishing the previous task.
- `#define SUPERVISION_CALLBACK`: Allows to specify a callback `Runnable` to be called when a task runs too long. When
    the callback returns, the CPU is restarted after 15 ms by the watchdog. The callback method is called directly
    from the watchdog interrupt. This means that e.g. `delay()` does not work.
- `#define SUPERVISION_CALLBACK_TIMEOUT`: Specify the timeout of the callback until the watchdog resets the CPU. Defaults to `WDTO_1S`.
- `#define AWAKE_INDICATION_PIN`: Show on a LED if the CPU is active or in sleep mode.  
HIGH = active, LOW = sleeping
- `#define SLEEP_TIME_XXX_CORRECTION`: Adjust the sleep time correction for the time when the CPU is in `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN` and waking up. See [Implementation Notes](#implementation-notes) and example [AdjustSleepTimeCorrections](https://github.com/PRosenb/DeepSleepScheduler/blob/master/examples/AdjustSleepTimeCorrections/AdjustSleepTimeCorrections.ino).

## Implementation Notes ##
- The watchdog timer is used to wake the CPU up from `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN` and for task supervision. It can therefore not be used for other means.
- It is possible to schedule callbacks in interrupts. The run time of the `scheduleXX()` methods is relatively short but it blocks execution of other interrupts. If you have very time critical interrupts, they may still be blocked for too long.  
- No matter how callbacks were scheduled, they are always run on the main thread. The scheduler can therefore be used as a convenient way to pass control from an interrupt to the main thread.
- Definition and code are in the header file. It is done like this to allow the user to configure the library by using `#define`. You can still include the header file in multiple files of a project by using `#define LIBCALL_DEEP_SLEEP_SCHEDULER`. See [Define Options](#define-options).
- When the CPU enters `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN`, the watchdog timer is used to wake it up again. The accuracy of the watchdog timer is not very well though. Further, the wake up time depends on the CPU type you are using. If you have certain time constraints, it may happen, that the schedule times are not precise enough.  
One possibility is to adapt the sleep time corrections by setting the defines `SLEEP_TIME_XXX_CORRECTION` (see [Define Options](#define-options) and example [AdjustSleepTimeCorrections](https://github.com/PRosenb/DeepSleepScheduler/blob/master/examples/AdjustSleepTimeCorrections/AdjustSleepTimeCorrections.ino)).  
An other option is to disable deep sleep (`SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN`) while scheduling with tight time constraints. To do so, use the methods `acquireNoDeepSleepLock()` and `releaseNoDeepSleepLock()` (see [Methods](#methods)). Please report values back to me if you do time measuring, thanks.
- While the CPU is in `SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN`, the millis timer is not running. For this reason the current uptime is not known when an external interrupt occurs during this time. Instead of the current uptime, the uptime when the CPU started to sleep is taken when calculating the schedule time of a delayed task. This  means that these tasks are potentially scheduled too early because the uptime is corrected when the sleep time is finished.
